# Dashboard - Environmental footprint of food products

This dashboard was created using Dash (Python-Plotly). It summarizes three different datasets: EDGAR - Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, GHG emissions across the food chain from Our World in Data, and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

It is possible to visualize the top 15 emitters with animal or plant-based origins. At the beginning of the dashboard, it is possible to select the origin of the food product, and it interacts with the emissions of the product and the visualization of worldwide distribution.

Finally, it displays a Sankey diagram of GHGs across the lifecycle of food production and consumption.
